				<h2>The Greatest Novel Of All Time</h2>
				<p class="meta">Published on <time datetime="2025-09-24">September 24, 2025</time> by Joshua McMahon</p>

				<p>Lord of the Mysteries (诡秘之主) is a Chinese western fantasy webnovel written by the Chinese author Cuttlefish That Loves Diving (爱潜水的乌贼). With the rising tide of steam power and machinery, who can come close to being a Beyonder? Shrouded in the fog of history and darkness, who or what is the lurking evil that murmurs into our ears? Waking up to be faced with a string of mysteries, Zhou Mingrui finds himself reincarnated as Klein Moretti in an alternate Victorian era world where he sees a world filled with machinery, cannons, dreadnoughts, airships, difference machines, as well as Potions, Divination, Hexes, Tarot Cards, Sealed Artifacts…</p>
				<p>The world is vastly complex and dangerous. A wrong step leads to severe consequences. The characters are twisted, perplexing, mysterious, lovable, greedy, loathsome, cunning, each with their own deep schemes. Be careful of your newborn baby—you never know he will destroy the city. Like the corresponding tarot card, The Fool, numbered 0—a number of unlimited potential—this is the legend of "The Fool."</p>

				<h2>The Greatest Anime Of All Time</h2>
				<p class="meta">Published on <time datetime="2025-09-24">September 24, 2025</time> by Joshua McMahon</p>
				<img src="Photos/Anime.jpg" alt="Promotional image from the anime Vivy" class="float-right">
				<p>Vivy is a strange blend of anime and science fiction tropes: out of control AI robots, vocaloid-esque performers, a secret double life, and a mission to help save the world. The combination is a bit clunky and the story is decent at best, yet the show is surprisingly entertaining. It offers great combat scenes, striking artistry, and a plot good enough to keep most viewers engaged, even with a few inconsistencies and repetition around the popstar theme.</p>
				<p>Each arc asks Vivy to change a critical moment in history without causing catastrophic divergence. This structure recalls Violet Evergarden—meeting people, making memories, and learning identity through purpose. While Vivy delivers emotion, it may not always land with the same impact, yet its unique blend earns it a place slightly off the beaten path with a finale that ties slower plot threads together, albeit a bit neatly.</p>
